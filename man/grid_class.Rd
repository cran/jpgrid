\arguments{
\item{x}{A list or vector.}

\item{strict}{A logical scalar. Should the number of digits in the grid
square code match a given number of digits?}
}
\value{
A \code{grid} vector.
}
\description{
A series of functions return \code{grid} class for each grid size.
\code{grid_auto} returns automatically determine grid size by the largest
grid size.
