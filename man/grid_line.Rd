\title{Draw line segments between grid square codes}
\usage{
grid_line(grid, grid_to = NULL, close = FALSE, skip_na = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{grid}{A \code{grid} vector or a list of \code{grid} vector.}

\item{grid_to}{A \code{grid} vector.}

\item{close}{Should the path of each element be closed when \code{grid} is a list?}

\item{skip_na}{Should skip the \code{NA} grid and connects the paths? \code{FALSE} by
default.}
}
\value{
A list of \code{grid} vectors.
}
\description{
If \code{grid} and \code{grid_to} are both vectors, the line between
\code{grid} and \code{grid_to} is drawn (using Bresenham's line algorithm).
If \code{grid} is a list, The path lines for each element in the grid will be
drawn.
